# SpaceY-capstone

In the competitive landscape of rocket launches, SpaceX stands out with their Falcon 9 rocket, which boasts a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than competitors' prices that reach $165 million. A key factor contributing to SpaceX's cost advantage is their successful reuse of the first stage. By accurately predicting the probability of first stage landing success, alternative companies can strategically determine the cost of their own launches. This crucial information holds the potential to empower these companies in bidding against SpaceX for rocket launch opportunities.

Imaging there is a SpaceY, who is the competitor for SpaceX. Using predictive models to find the probability of successfully landing and reusing the first stage of the rockets and calculating the optimal cost each launch to compete with SpaceX

- Gather information about spacex 
- Create dashboard for the team
- Determine if spacex will reuse the first stage
  - Use ML model and public info to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage
